# Etch-a-sketch

This is a project where I am creating a website where a user can draw. The user is able to select a color and size of the grid, then they can draw on the grid by clicking and dragging their mouse across the canvas.

## How it works

- Slider: Changes the size of the grid

- Color Picker: Allows you to pick color

- Clear: Clears grid or you could just refresh the page too
